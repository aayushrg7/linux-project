## ðŸŒŸ Linux Project
- This script customizes your Linux setup by grabbing my configs and replacing the default settings.

## ðŸš€ Installation

The installation script is designed for Arch-based systems.

> [!CAUTION]
> This script configures default settings and adds my custom configs. Itâ€™s designed for Arch-based systems and currently supports SwayWM. If SwayWM isn't installed, the script will skip that section and apply my vimrc config and plugins instead.

To setup, execute the following commands:

```shell
sudo pacman -Syy git
git clone https://github.com/aayushx402/linux-project
cd linux-project/
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**If anything goes wrong, run the following commands in your terminal:**

```shell
# ðŸ†™ Update your system and install git
sudo pacman -Syy git

# ðŸ“¥ Clone the project repository
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/aayushx402/linux-project

# ðŸ“‚ Navigate to the project directory
cd linux-project/

# ðŸ”’ Make the setup script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# ðŸš€ Run the setup script
./setup.sh
```

### Updating
To update script, you will need to pull the latest changes from GitHub and restore the configs by running the following commands:

```shell
cd ~/linux-project
git pull
./setup.sh
```
