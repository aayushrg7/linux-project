## Linux Project
- This script customizes your Linux setup by grabbing my configs and replacing the default settings.

## Installation

The installation script is designed for Arch-based systems.

> CAUTION!
> This script configures default settings and adds my custom configs. Itâ€™s designed for Arch-based systems and currently supports SwayWM. If SwayWM isn't installed, the script will skip that section and apply my vimrc config and plugins instead.

After installing Vim and SwayWM, run:

```shell
sudo pacman -Syy git
git clone https://github.com/aayushx402/linux-project
cd linux-project/
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

Second Method:

```shell
pacman -Syy git
git clone https://github.com/aayushx402/linux-project
cd linux-project/src
chmod +x main.rs
./main.rs
```

This script runs my main Rust program. You might need to install Rust if it's not already present.


## Update
- Added my vimrc and plugins
