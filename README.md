## Linux Project
- This script customizes your Linux setup by grabbing my configs and replacing the default settings.

## Installation

The installation script is made for Arch Based System.

> CAUTION!
> This script is designed to configure the defaults configs and add on my configs it will work on arch based system for now. Make sure you are using swayr WM for this config but not to worry if the swayr WM not found in your system it will automatically skip that part and applied my vimrc config and plugin

After installing vim and swayr, execute -

```shell
pacman -Syy git
git clone https://github.com/aayushx402/linux-project
cd linux-project/
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

After the installation is finished the script will automaticly reboot into the new enviroment.
